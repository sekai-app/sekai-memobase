---

Leverage the power of long-term memory in your Dify applications by connecting them to Memobase Cloud. This guide explains how to use the Memobase plugin for Dify.

## Prerequisites
Please search for memobase in the Dify plugin marketplace, [the plugin](https://github.com/ACAne0320/dify-plugin-memobase) is open-source!

Before you can use the plugin, you need access to Memobase Dashboard:

*   **Memobase Dashboard:** Sign up for a managed Memobase instance through the [Memobase dashboard](https://www.memobase.io/en/dashboard). This is the quickest way to get started without needing to manage your own infrastructure.
*   **Self-Hosted Instance:** You can deploy your own instance of Memobase. Visit the [Memobase GitHub repository](https://github.com/memodb-io/memobase) for installation instructions and more information.

## Plugin Setup in Dify

To integrate Memobase with Dify using the plugin, you'll need to add it as a tool in your Dify application and provide the necessary credentials for your Memobase Cloud instance:

1.  **Memobase URL:** The API endpoint URL of your Memobase Cloud instance. This will be provided in your Memobase Cloud dashboard (e.g., `https://api.memobase.dev`).
2.  **Memobase API Key:** Your unique API key for authenticating with your Memobase Cloud instance. You can obtain this from your [Memobase dashboard](https://www.memobase.io/en/dashboard).

You can find these details in your Memobase Cloud dashboard.

## Using the Plugin in Dify Workflows

After setting up the plugin, you can incorporate its tools into your Dify workflows to:

*   **Store Conversation History:** Persist dialogue turns for long-term recall and context.
*   **Personalize Responses:** Retrieve user profiles or contextual data from Memobase to tailor AI agent interactions.
*   **Access Past Interactions:** Search and utilize past user events or stored data.
*   **Manage Memobase Data:** Directly manipulate user information and other data within your Memobase instance from Dify.

For detailed instructions on each tool's parameters and capabilities, refer to the [Memobase API Reference](https://docs.memobase.io/api-reference/overview).
